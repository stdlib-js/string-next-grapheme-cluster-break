    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
import nextGraphemeClusterBreak from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/string-next-grapheme-cluster-break@esm/index.mjs';
```
The previous example will load the latest bundled code from the esm branch. Alternatively, you may load a specific version by loading the file from one of the [tagged bundles](https://github.com/stdlib-js/string-next-grapheme-cluster-break/tags). For example,

```javascript
import nextGraphemeClusterBreak from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/string-next-grapheme-cluster-break@v0.1.0-esm/index.mjs';
```

#### nextGraphemeClusterBreak( string\[, fromIndex] )

Returns the next extended grapheme cluster break in a string after a specified position.

```javascript
var out = nextGraphemeClusterBreak( 'last man standing' );
// returns 1
```

By default, the function searches for a grapheme cluster break starting from the first index. To specify an alternative starting search index, provide a `fromIndex` argument.

```javascript
var out = nextGraphemeClusterBreak( 'last man standing', 4 );
// returns 5
```

<section class="notes">

## Notes

-   If `string` is an empty string, the function returns `-1` irrespective of `fromIndex`.
-   If an extended grapheme cluster break does not exist after `fromIndex`, the function returns `-1`.
-   Note that `fromIndex` does **not** refer to a visual character position, but to an index in the ordered sequence of [UTF-16][utf-16] code units.
